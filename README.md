# cnn_cifar10
Using 3-layer CNN on CIFAR10 dataset

Train accuracy: 78.25%
Test accuracy: 77.6%

This model performed better than the 3-layer MLP model I implemented which had a test accuracy of only 52.2%

This is the highest accuracy I got after a few experiments with the parameters.  

Recommendation: Increasing the number of filters, batch size, epoch and other parameters during training may yield better results. Just be careful not to overfit. 

Hardware Limitation: 2GB MX150 GPU only
